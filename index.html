      <p><a href="Paper1_ProfitPlaner_PhDthesis.pdf" class="circular-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Profit or Planet? Both! ESG Drivers of Efficient Portfolios and the Costs of Disclosure</strong></a><p>
        <p>I adopt an asset pricing perspective to highlight ESG-type metrics for the construction of efficient portfolios. Additionally, I show that ESG disclosure may divert company resources toward long-term sustainable investment over investment for growth and profitability in the short term. This study integrates the ESG variables in the portfolio creation process using the five-factor asset pricing model by Fama and French and a model-free methodology represented by machine learning. With the first model, I consider five global markets with rolling time windows. The main focus of the markets for the governance pillar seems related to board characteristics and functions. The social pillar shows the significance of employee-related issues in different markets. For the environmental variables, investors appear to focus on greenhouse emissions within the Asia-Pacific, European, and Northern American markets. The machine learning algorithm is a customized random forest that represents an empirically grounded method to highlight material financial and ESG variables for the creation of efficient sustainable portfolios. The results provide the main drivers yielding the excess returns of the best sustainable portfolios at the sector level. Finally, I test the ESG prediction power of fundamentals and study the cost of ESG. I find that governance practices predict higher returns on assets and cash flow generation. On the other hand, ESG disclosure seems to affect capital expenditures and investment negatively. The results support the idea that non-financial disclosure is costly in the short term but yields long-term benefits.</p>  
        <p><strong>Climate Risk and Brand Capital</strong> <em> (joint work with Giudici, G., Konstantios, D.)</em> <p>
         <p>This study investigates the relationship between firm-level climate risk and brand capital. Analyzing an international panel of 5,862 firms from 2001-2022, we find that firms exposed to climate risk tend to have reduced brand capital. Our analysis indicates that the value of a marginal dollar of cash on brand value is significantly lower in firms with high climate risk exposure compared to those with low exposure. Additionally, the adverse impact of climate risk on brand capital is more pronounced for firms with higher levels of brand capital. We employ a quasi-natural experiment centered on the Paris Agreement to establish causality. Our findings remain robust across various estimation techniques that account for endogeneity, self-selection, and model sensitivity. </p>
        <p><strong>What’s News with You: Price Forecasting and Sentiment Scores</strong> <em>(joint work with Leone, F., Marazzina, D.)</em><p>
           <p>We adopt deep learning models to forecast stock prices and to compute news sentiment scores. The aim is to determine the predictive power of the sentiment for the Dow Jones Industrial Average index price. More precisely, we employ N-HiTS, a neural network architecture designed for time series forecasting, and RoBERTa, a powerful tool in sentiment analysis, to predict next-day closing prices exploiting sentiment scores and historical closing prices. We find that the N-HiTS model, when trained with comprehensive sentiment data from all news, significantly outperforms all the considered models across all key metrics. A model trained exclusively with ESG news sentiment improves upon the baseline model in the directional accuracy, delivering the best-predicting power of the price downward movements. </p>
       <p><strong>Integrated Risk Indexing: Bridging Financial and Credit Risk with Multidimensional Data</strong><p>
        <p>I create an index that measures the risk of investment funds using a traditional econometrics tool (PCA) and a machine learning algorithm (autoencoder). The composite index measure follows the classical signaling method of credit ratings. I include financial risk variables, ESG ratings, macroeconomic variables, and fund characteristics to obtain a composite measure to categorize fund risk. The customized autoencoder performs better than the PCA allowing us to obtain an index that contains multiple sources of information and respects the directionality of the variables concerning risk. Therefore, I contribute to the risk management and decisional process for the investment funds evaluation by introducing a more complete and comprehensive measure of risk.</p>
        <p><strong>How Should Society Ensure Against Natural Disaster</strong><p>
        <p>I study the effects of Extreme Weather Events on the corporate value of European Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. Additionally, I evaluate whether firms insure against natural disasters. Indeed, I study the effects of the European Solidarity Funds trying to uncover the effectiveness of these funds for climate change adaptation and risk prevention. The existing literature extensively studies the interactions between climate events and financial markets. The empirical literature mainly focuses on the pricing of climate risks for different asset classes. Furthermore, it explores the propagation and amplification of shocks along the supply chain. Conversely, this study contemplates the effect of a broader set of events on the performance of European SMEs and studies the effectiveness of the European Solidarity Funds. Our first estimate proposes a difference-in-differences (DiD) strategy in which the event is the exogenous shock for the treated group. I should consider that there may be a spatial correlation in the treatment. </p>
        <p><strong>Should I Stay or Should I Go? Transfers, Trade Gains, and Capital Accumulation in a Fiscal Union</strong><p>
       <p>We study the attainability of a fiscal union model for countries in the European Monetary Union (EMU). Recent research typically limits risk-sharing in a monetary union by introducing limited commitment frictions. Conversely, this paper contemplates productivity shocks for countries in the currency union to evaluate the viability of a fiscal union. The research proposes two models. Firstly, we propose a multi-country static model where countries share risk internationally through state-contingent transfers. In this setting, we compare welfare effects from transfers and trade gains for each country of the EMU. Therefore, we aim to establish whether the trade gains in the currency union compensate for the loss of transfers in the fiscal union, especially for high-productivity and high-income countries. The second is a dynamic model where taxes and subsidies of the EU central government redistribute wealth across countries. The value-added of this dynamic model is the evaluation of the sustainability of the transfers in the fiscal union. Additionally, the government enforces capital accumulation to increase the future productivity of a low productive country and therefore overcomes moral hazard issues. Therefore, we expect to find that, in addition to the trade gains and the multiple social benefits, remaining in the union might represent an insurance mechanism against future shocks for all the members.   </p>
